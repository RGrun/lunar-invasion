# Lunar Invasion

#### Note: This is old code and not reflective of my current abilities and style.

I built this game over a period of eight months in 2015. I led a team of three people as we designed, 
built and implemented the game.

The game uses OpenGL ES for rendering, and is built on a custom engine.
 
 You can find the game here, on the Google Play Store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=r3software.org.lunarinvasion&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=r3software.org.lunarinvasion&hl=en)
